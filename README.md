# GradientNavigationBar

GradientNavigationBar is a drop in subclass of UINavigationBar that easily allows you to set the background to be a gradient. It supports SafeAreaLayoutGuide so it looks great on iPhone X and 3rd generation iPad Pro devices.

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 10.0+
- Swift 4.2+

## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate GradientNavigationBar into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "CanopyTax/GradientNavigationBar" ~> 0.1.5
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `GradientNavigationBar.framework` into your Xcode project.

### CocoaPods

Coming Soon

### Manually

If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate GradientNavigationBar into your project manually.
